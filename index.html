      <p>
        I am originally from Cincinnati Ohio. I moved down south to the Carolinas when I was 13. I have been back and forth between
        the Carlinas and Tennessee since that time, from Fort Mill, SC, to Charlotte, NC to Koxville, TN to Nashville, TN.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2004 I graduated High School in Fort Mill and went on to attend the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. From there I
        graduated with a BA in Phsychology in 2009. The job market was not fantastic at the time of my graduation, and I
        ended up working several part time jobs to get by. It wasn't until two years later in 2011 that I decided to obtain
        my Insurance Adjusters license in order to be able to work a single job that allowed me to make a comfortable living.
        Since that time, I have been working in an industry out of necessity, with no love for my work. I wanted to get into
        an industry that would not only allow me to make a decent living, but also would allow me to enjoy my work and pursue
        creativity and inovation. I finaly made the decision that it was time to change careers. With this class, I hope
        to be able to realize my dream of being able to not only provide a comfortable life for myself and my family, but
        to be able to finaly pursue my dreams of becoming an entrepreneur or working for a company in a field in which I
        enjoy.
